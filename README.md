## PHP Tic Tac Toe

### Requirements
You will need to have `PHP 5x` installed on your machine. You can quickly grab a php vagrant machine [here](http://puphpet.com).

### Install
`git clone` this repository locally and run `php scripts/tictactoe.php`. The program will start, good luck with beating the Ai ;)

## Interesting Notes
The AI will never lose. At best you can `Draw`. The Ai will apply the strategy mentioned on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).

## Interesting bits of code
The Ai implements a series of rules, which are listed by priority. The most interesting rules are [Fork](https://github.com/jnardiello/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/src/Rules/ForkRule.php) and [BlockOpponentFork](https://github.com/jnardiello/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/src/Rules/BlockOpponentForkRule.php) as the Ai will run a real simulation to understand if it is possible to generate a fork or if you are going to fork anytime soon.
